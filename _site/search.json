The simplest way to check if you have it and what version you are using is to open a terminal (using terminal application) and typing:\ngit --version\nYou should see some repsonse that looks like:\ngit version 2.39.5 (Apple Git-154)\nOn Windows you might want to download git for windows (https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) which includes a Git Bash which can use the CLIs.\n\n\nAfterwards\nOnce we get beyond the CLI, you may want to move to your code editor or IDE of choice (R studio, pycharm, VS Code etc) all have git integrated into them.\nIn VS Code:\n\nIn RStudio:\nIf there is an existing repository, you have to add a “New Project” in that directory first, then you will see:\n\nThese may be a more comfortable way to manage your project, but under the hood, they are really just doing the same couple of commands with `git` that we are going to use"
