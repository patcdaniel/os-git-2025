## Version Control ##

::: {.incremental}
- A way of __tracking__ and <u>managing</u> changes made to files overtime.
  
- __git__ is very popular, but other open VC include:
   - Mercurial
   - SVN
   - Source Code Control System

::: {.nonincremental}
- __Free, open source, distributed, version control system__  

- Git is a software for managing software development through time and space.

## What about Github? ##

Github (__Microsoft__) is a DevOPS service used to store and distribute code repositories that __uses `git`__. <br>  
Some other DevOP git-based repository:

::: {.incremental}
   - bitbucket (Atlassian)
   - gitlab (open core: git.ucsc.edu)
   - HuggingFace (for Models and Datasets (large data))

:::


## What problems does VC solve? ##
__Scenario__

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
```
You've made some big changes to your code and things aren't working and now your results make no sense. Now you have to thumb through 10 different files called something like `final_PLS_MBAY_Fall_v2_new.py`.
```
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
__Scenario__
```
You are working with a collaborator on an analysis and want to incorporate some changes they made without having to start over on your changes.
```
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
__Scenario__
```
You published some results and are getting questions about what parameters you used for a model, but you have since developed the project further and don't remeber what you did.
```
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
__Scenario__
```
You need to send a project (code,data,figures) to collaborator but things are getting out of control with the number of files.
```

## However, GitHUB is NOT a Data Repository

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
There is no guaranetee that something you upload to github will persist. <br>
:::
<br>  

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Better places to __archive__ data or code with a paper or dataset, though better than nothing!
:::
<br>  

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
See __Zenodo__ or __DataOne__ or more domain specific data repositories (GBIF, OBIS, WOD)
:::

## Basic GIT workflow ##

::: {.incremental}
1. Create files - these may contain text, code or both.
2. Work on these files, by changing, deleting or adding new content.
3. Create a snapshot of the file status (also known as version) at this time.
4. Document what was changed in the version history of that file.

## Linear Development ##

<br>
<br>
![](https://book.the-turing-way.org/_images/main-branch.png)
<br>
<br>
Suppose you need to get back to a previous version of your code.

## Non-linear Development ##
__Adding a Feature:__
<br>
![](https://book.the-turing-way.org/_images/one-branch.png)
<br>

You maybe working on a new feature that allows you to read different types of files, but processes still runs the same analysis. 

:::{.incremental}
__When that standalone feature is completed, it can be added back into the main working branch__

## Non-linear Development ##

__Real Life Development:__
<br>  

![](https://book.the-turing-way.org/_images/sub-branch.png){width="90%"}  

[This may seem like overkill for  a project that you are working on yourself, but if you develop a popular package and others start to ask for features or better yet, offer to add their own features, this is what modern software development looks like.]{style="font-size: 23px; font-weight: bold;"}

# Start Your Engines #

## The basics of Git ##

__`git init`__:_initialize_ a git repository in your current directory.
This will create a hidden file called .git.  
__`git add file.txt`__:Tells git to start tracking this file for changes. More likely you will add many files at once.  
__`git commit`__:Tells git that you want to commit all of the changes to the tracked files (from the previous step).  
__`git push`__:Push the changes to a remote repository like __Github__ or __gitlab__

## Try it out ##

__Let's all try this out in the `command line`__:

:::{.incremental}
- Open a terminal.
- Make a new directory: `mkdir learning-git`
- Move into that diretory: `cd learning-git`
- Initialize a repo: `git init`  
- Check what is going on: `git status` (you should see some about 'No commits yet', if it says fatal, no repo was initialized)  
:::

## Checking if it worked ##
<br>
Try running: __`git status`__
<br>
![](media/git-status.png){width=60%}

## Now Make a file and add it to git ##

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
<br>
__Try these bash commands__:

<br>

::: {.incremental}
- `touch file.txt`
- `git add file.txt`
- `git status`
:::
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

![](media/git-status-2.png){width=100%}  
__These are 'staged' changes__  
:::
::::

## Commit! ##

::: {.incremental}

- __`git commit`__ <br> git expects a message when you make a commit, so it may open `vim` editor.<br>`vim`: type in your messages, press `esc`, then `:x` to write out to the file. Ask if you are stuck!  

<br>

- __Instead, include an inline message:__<br>`git commit -m "This is my commit message"`  

:::
##
__`git log`__

![](media/git-log.png)

<p style='font-size:16px;'>This shows our last commit, the hash associated with it, and the message</p>


## Excercise ##
<br>
<br>

:::{.incremental}
1. Add some text to the file.txt
2. Add the file to git (hint: __`git add .`__ will add all files in dir)
3. Commit the staged files
4. View the log
:::


##
__What if you want to go back to an older commit?__ 

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="40%"}

![](media/git-log-2.png){width="100%"}
:::

:::{.column width="60%"}
:::{.incremental}
- Last Commit: __`git revert HEAD`__ (this is like a reverse commit)  

- Older Commit: [__`git checkout 4d95c68fa8060e34f08d9e4309d13873af9a5881`__]{style="font-size:24px;"} (enter the hash of that commit, not mine)<br>This called a __"detached HEAD"__ --> Not at the front of the branch.
:::
:::
::::

## Branches: Creating ##
![](https://book.the-turing-way.org/_images/one-branch.png)  
<br>  
Those splits are called branches, this a nice way to try something without writing over the `main` branch.  


::: {.fragment .fade-in}
__To Create and Switch to a new Branch:__  

__`git checkout -b name_of_your_new_branch`__
:::


## Branches: Switching Between ##

:::{.incremental}

- __`git branch`__<p style="font-size: 22px;">show different branches</p>

- __`git checkout name_of_branch`__<p style="font-size: 22px;">change to the `name_of_branch` branch</p>

- __`git branch -D name_of_branch`__<p style="font-size: 22px;">Delete `name_of_branch` branch <br><br> Note: `main` is the default branch. (Used to be `master`, but this has been phased out)</p>
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

Excercise:<br>__Create and checkout a new branch. Add a file to it and commit the new file (and any other changes)__

:::

## Merging Branches

Once you have completed the cool feature that you want to integrate into the `main` branch, you will need to __`merge`__.  
<br>  

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Move into the the branch that you want merged into (`main`).  <br>  
__`git merge name_of_branch`__  
:::  
<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
<p style="font-size: 24px;">You can get into trouble here if you make changes to your `main` branch and that will conflict with the changes make in your other branch that you are trying to merge in. This is a bit beyond the scope of what we are talking about here, but it will be illustrated later.</p>

Let's take a short break. Ask Question

The next part will be working with github.
